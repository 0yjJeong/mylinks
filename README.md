## Getting started

### Install Dependencies

To run the app, you will need to have [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git), [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed.

### Setting environment values

## Running Locally

From the root of the project directory, run the following in a terminal to build each packages:

```bash
$ yarn run build
```

Once each package is built, open a separate terminal window and start the server and client using the following commands from the project root:

```bash
$ yarn run dev
```

The final `yarn run dev` command should open a local instance of example in your browser.
